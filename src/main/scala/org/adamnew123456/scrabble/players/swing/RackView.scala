/**
 * The RackView is responsible for visualizing the contents of the player's
 * rack of tiles using several TileViews.
 * 
 * Since the RackView can be in one of three modes, there are two selections
 * used to communicate with other components:
 * 
 * - The boardSelection is used to communicate with the BoardView, during the
 *   UIMode.Turn mode. It facilitates moving tiles from the rack to the board
 *   and vice versa.
 * - The replaceSelection is used to communicate with the main turn driver
 *   which tiles are selected for replacing during the UIMode.Replace mode.

   * - UIMode.Replace

   * These modes carry with them different behaviors; the current mode of the
   * RackView determines which should run. To avoid bulking up the various 
   * callbacks with dispatch code, this interface makes it possible to swap
   * out the current RackCallbackSuite and automatically have all callbacks
   * be changed.
   * 
   * Also, the modes themselves can carry state which isn't necessary for the 
   * other modes. This helps segregate state which shouldn't be mixing around
   * in the top-level of RackView
